# Mentorship-Record
This data structure is designed for mentorship record by providing a suitable solution to the university faculty.

Each student is assigned a mentor at Level, each level of student can mentor **ONE** lower level student. Level 5 students are assigned to mentor Level 4 students. Level 6 students can mentor Level 5 students. Each student is mentored by only one student. However, each student mentor can mentor several students.

In the table, P2531111 and P2530001 are both Level 6 mentors, P2531120, P2532211 and P2534141 are Level 5 mentors but are also mentees to Level 6 students. P2530201, P2530150, P2530190, P2530210< P2530229 and P2530250 are Level 4 mentees. P2530230 is a Level 5 student who is yet to be allocated a mentee.

Based on the scenario this program has given an appropriate Abstract Data Type (ADT) solution to demonstrate a suitable data structure to allocate students and details, for instance, details of mentor and mentees, modify mentors and mentees, output details of each mentor and mentees.

This program has the abilities to support the following operations:
*Assign student mentors to mentees
*Let the user search for a mentee determine if the mentor has been assinged
*Find a mentor for a given mentee
*Let the user search for a mentor
*Find all mentees for the given mentor
*Reassign mentors
*Reassign mentees
*Remove mentors
*Remove mentees at any level of study
